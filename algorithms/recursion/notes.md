## Algorithms - Recursion

Recusion is when you define something in terms of itself, it's a function that refers to itself inside of the function.

### Anatomy of Recursion

- Recursive functions have 2 cases:

1. recursive case - calling itself
2. base case - telling it when to stop calling the recursive case

## Recusrive Rules

1. identify the base case
2. identify the recursive case
3. return when needed
