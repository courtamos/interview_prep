## Data Structures - Stacks and Queues

Stacks and queues are similar, in that they are linear data structures. These data structures allow us to traverse but only deal with elements at the beginning off end.

## Stacks

- Stacks can be thought of as a stack of plates, you can only touch the plate on the top. This follows the 'LIFO' structure, 'last in first out'.

###### Big-O Time Complexities

- lookup: O(n)
- pop: O(1)
- push: O(1)
- peek: O(1)

## Queues

- Queues can be thought about as a lineup, the person at the front of the lineup gets to go first and so on. This follows the 'FIFO' structure, 'first in first out'.

###### Big-O Time Complexities

- lookup: O(n)
- enqueue: O(1)
- dequeue: O(1)
- peek: O(1)

## Pros && Cons

- Pros:

1. fast operations
2. fast peek
3. ordered

- Cons:

1. slow lookup
