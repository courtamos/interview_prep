## Data Structures - Objects (Hash Tables)

Objects are made up of key and value pairs

Big-O Time Complexities

- insert: O(1)
- lookup: O(1)
- delete: O(1)
- serach: O(1)

## Objects VS Maps VS Sets

1. Objects only allow strings for key values, and they do not maintain insertion order.

2. Maps allows you to save any data type as a key, they also maintains insertion order.

3. Sets, very similar to maps, but they only store the keys and no values.
