## Data Structures - Linked Lists

Linked lists contain sets of nodes, which have 2 elements. The first is the value of the data you want to store and the second is the pointer which points to the next node in line.

- Linked lists are null terminated

Big-O Time Complexities

- prepend: O(1)
- append: O(1)
- lookup: O(n)
- insert: O(n)
- delete: O(n)

## Linked Lists Types

There are 2 types of linked lists:

1. singly linked
2. doubly linked

## Why Linked Lists VS Arrays OR Objects

1. loose structure: you can esaily insert a new value into the middle of the list by resetting a few pointers
