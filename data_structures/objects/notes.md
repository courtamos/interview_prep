## Data Structures - Objects (Hash Tables)

Objects are made up of key and value pairs

Big-O Time Complexities

- insert: O(1)
- lookup: O(1)
- delete: O(1)
- serach: O(1)

## Objects VS Maps VS Sets

1. Objects only allow strings for key values, and they do not maintain insertion order.

2. Maps allows you to save any data type as a key, they also maintains insertion order.

3. Sets, very similar to maps, but they only store the keys and no values.

## Objects VS Arrays

- Arrays

1. search: O(n)
2. lookup: O(1)
3. push: O(1)
4. insert: O(n)
5. delete: O(n)

- Objects

1. search: O(1)
2. insert: O(1)
3. lookup: O(1)
4. delete: O(1)

## Why Use Objects (PROS)

1. fast lookups
2. fast inserts
3. flexible keys

## Why NOT Use Objects (CONS)

1. unordered
2. slow key iteration
