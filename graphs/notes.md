## Data Structures - Graphs

A graph is a set of values that are related in a pairwise fashion. Each item in a graph is called a node/vertex, and each node/vortex are connected with edges.

### Ways to Describe Graphs

1. Directed VS Undirected

- directied graphs have one flow direction (similar to a one way street)
- undirected graphs can flow in multiple directions (similar to a stand street with right and left side)

2. Weighted VS Unweighted

- weighted graphs contain no information in the edges
- unweighted graphs contain information in the edges

3. Cyclic VS Acyclic

- cyclic graphs are connected in a circular fashion, where you are able to cycle from one node/vertex to another and back to the original.
- acyclic graphs are not connected in a circular fashion

### Pros and Cons

1. Pros:

- relationships

2. Cons:

- scaling is hard
